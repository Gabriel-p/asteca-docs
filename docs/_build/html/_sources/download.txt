Download
========

The latest packaged release (zip or tarball) can be downloaded from:

-  **ASteCA** `.zip`_
-  **ASteCA** `.tar.gz`_

After downloading, extract the compressed file wherever you want
the code to exist.
No further installation is necessary with the exception of the
requirements listed below.


Requirements
------------

The code has been tested with the July 2014 release of **python**:

-  `Python - 2.7.8`_

It should also work on older versions, if you encounter any problems
please contact me or `open a new issue`_.

To check the version of **python** installed in your system simply run in
a terminal the command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python --version

The output will resemble this:

.. code-block:: bash

  Python 2.7.3

If your version is ``2.7.x`` you are probably good to go. If you are using
the new ``3.x`` version of **python** I assume you know what you are doing
and can figure out how to run the code in a ``2.7.x`` environment.


Python dependencies
-------------------

The packages listed below are required to run **ASteCA**.

-  `Numpy - 1.8.2`_
-  `Matplotlib - 1.3.1`_ 
-  `SciPy - 0.14.0`_

These versions are the ones I used, the code could work with older
versions of the packages but I can't guarantee it.
The recommended way to install each of the above packages is to
use `pip`_ (see `the docs`_ for more information on this tool):

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install numpy
  $ pip install matplotlib
  $ pip install scipy

If **pip** is not installed in your system, you can install it
(assuming **python** is) via:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ python get-pip.py


Python distributions
--------------------

An alternative to installing packages separately is to download a **python**
distribution which comes with many packages already installed:

-  `Anaconda`_
-  `Canopy`_

The best and easiest way to install and manage several versions of
**python** and its packages without affecting your system is `pyenv`_.


Extra packages
--------------

If you want to use the `function`_ that obtains the cluster probability
of being a true cluster, the following software is needed:

-  `R - 3.0.1`_

which can be installed with:

.. code-block:: bash

 $ sudo apt-get install r-base

After **R** is installed, open with sudo privileges (``sudo R``) and
install, *in order*, the packages (installation commands to the right):

-  rgl – ``install.packages("rgl")``
-  mvtnorm – ``install.packages("mvtnorm")``
-  misc3d – ``install.packages("misc3d")``
-  ks – ``install.packages("ks")``

The package that allows ``python`` and ``R`` to communicate is also
needed:

-  `rpy2 -2.4.3`_ –  ``pip install rpy2``

These extra packages are *not mandatory* and **ASteCA** will still run without
them, just not the particular function mentioned above.


Cloning the repository
----------------------

The entire project can be cloned via `git`_. Simply
locate yourself in the folder you want the code to be downloaded and
run the following command in a terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/Gabriel-p/asteca.git

This will create a new sub-folder named ``/asteca`` with all the code
stored inside.
