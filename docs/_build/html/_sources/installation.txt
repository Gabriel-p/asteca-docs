Download
========

The latest packaged release (zip or tarball) can be downloaded from:

-  `.zip`_
-  `.tar.gz`_

You can alternatively checkout the entire project via `git`_. Simply
locate yourself in the folder you want the code to be downloaded and
run the following command in terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/Gabriel-p/asteca.git

This will create a new sub-folder named ``/asteca`` with all the code
stored inside. No installation is necessary.


Requirements
------------

The code has been tested with the July 2014 release of **python**:

-  `Python - 2.7.8`_

It should also work on older versions, if you encounter any problems
please contact me or `open a new issue`_.

To check the version of python installed simply run in a terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python

The output will resemble this:

.. code-block:: bash

  Python 2.7.7 (default, Sep  1 2014, 11:47:35) 
  [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> 

If your version is ``2.7.x`` you are good to go. If you are using the new
``3.x`` version of **python** I assume you know what you are doing and can
figure out how to run the code in a ``2.7.x`` environment.

Python dependencies
-------------------

The packages listed below are required to run ``ASteCA``.

-  `Numpy - 1.8.2`_ – ``pip install numpy``
-  `Matplotlib - 1.3.1`_ – ``pip install matplotlib``
-  `SciPy - 0.14.0`_ – ``pip install scipy``

These versions are the ones I used, the code could work with older
versions of the packages but I can’t guarantee it.

Python distributions
--------------------

An alternative to installing packages separately is to download a **python**
distribution which comes with many packages already installed:

-  `Anaconda`_
-  `Canopy`_

The best and easiest way to install and manage several versions of
**python** and its packages without affecting your system is `pyenv`_.
See hte 


Extra packages
--------------

If you want to use the `function`_ that obtains the cluster probability
of being a true cluster, the following software is needed:

-  `R - 3.0.1`_ – ``sudo apt-get install r-base``

After it is installed, open with sudo privileges (``sudo R``) and
install, *in order*, the packages:

-  rgl – ``install.packages("rgl")``
-  mvtnorm – ``install.packages("mvtnorm")``
-  misc3d – ``install.packages("misc3d")``
-  ks – ``install.packages("ks")``

The package that allows ``python`` and ``R`` to communicate is also
needed:

-  `rpy2 -2.4.3`_ – ``pip install rpy2``

These extra packages are not mandatory and ``ASteCA`` will still run without
them, just not that particular function.


Theoretical isochrones
----------------------

``ASteCA`` needs at least one set of theoretical isochrones stored in a
``/asteca/isochrones`` folder to be able to apply the function that
estimates the clusters’ parameters. `Girardi isochrones`_ are currently
the default but any set can in practice be used (with minor changes made
to the code)

The isochrones can be downloaded manually or the package `ezPadova-2`_
can be used to automatically fetch them from the site.
