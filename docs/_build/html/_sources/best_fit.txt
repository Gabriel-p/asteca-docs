Best fit model

The functions involved in the best fit process aim at obtaining
the observed cluster's parameters (metallicity, age, extinction, distance,
binarity, mass), along with the uncertainties in each value.

The process basically consists in comparing the observed cluster's photometric
diagram with the diagrams of many synthetic clusters, and selecting the one
that shows the "best match".
