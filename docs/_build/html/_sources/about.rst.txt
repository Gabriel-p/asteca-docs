About
=====

**ASteCA** is an open source code developed entirely in Python, designed to
fully automatize the usual tests applied to stellar clusters (SC) in order to
determine their characteristics: center, radius, stars' membership probabilities
and associated intrinsic/extrinsic parameters: metallicity, age, extinction,
distance, binarity, and total mass.

The code is designed modularly thus allowing the user to select which
tests to run and which to skip, all managed through a simple input data
file.

**ASteCA** is intended to run without the need for user intervention but
both a semi-automatic and a manual mode are made available in case user
input is necessary or required.
