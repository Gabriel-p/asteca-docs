Download
========

The latest packaged release (zip or tarball) can be downloaded from:

-  **ASteCA** `.zip`_
-  **ASteCA** `.tar.gz`_

After downloading, extract the compressed file wherever you want
the code to exist.
No further installation is necessary with the exception of the
requirements listed below in Sect :ref:`sect-requirements`.

Cloning the repository
----------------------

The entire project can be cloned via `git`_. To install ``git`` run:

.. code-block:: bash

 $ sudo apt-get install git

After that, simply locate yourself in the folder you want the code to be
downloaded and run the following command in a terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/asteca/ASteCA.git

This will create a new sub-folder named ``/ASteCA`` with all the necessary
files and code stored inside.
